    "\n",
    "One ML algorithm we didn't cover during class is the nearest neighbor algorithm. The principle behind nearest neighbors is to base your prediction for a given point on the true labels of a predefined number of training samples closest to that point in the feature space. The predicted label is some sort of average of the true labels of the nearest neighbors. The number of nearest neighbors is a user-defined constant (k-nearest neighbor learning) which is one of the hyperparameters you'll need to tune. \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge in this technique is the distance metric. How do you measure the distance between two points in the feature space? This is non-trivial question because usually different continuous features have different units and order of magnitudes, some features are one-hot-encoded, some features are ordinal. The key to successfully apply this method is usually to create a custom distance metric tailored to your dataset. However the standard Euclidean (geometric) distance is often used after the features are standard scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(This is not necessary to know, but is still interesting)** The nearest-neighbor algorithm is unique because there is no model to train. The algorithm merely stores the training data in memory, and then checks which training points are closest to a given prediction point. This makes the nearest-neighbor algorithm train in O(1) time, but predict in O(n) time (with n referring to the number of **training** points, not testing). Generally, this is the opposite of what we want in an ML model -- it's much better to spend time precomputing than it is to spend time while predicting. Regardless, nearest-neighbors is still a very useful algorithm in some circumstances!\n",

   "source": "**Error Explanation:**\nWhen trying to use `n_neighbors=30`, we encounter a ValueError because we only have 21 training samples (70% of 30 total samples). KNN requires at least `n_neighbors` samples in the training set. The fix is to use `n_neighbors ≤ 21` (the size of our training set).\n\n**Bias-Variance Analysis:**\n- **High bias (low variance)**: Large `n_neighbors` values (e.g., n=10, n=21) produce smoother predictions by averaging many neighbors. This leads to underfitting - the model is too simple to capture the sine wave pattern.\n- **High variance (low bias)**: Small `n_neighbors` values (e.g., n=1) create highly flexible models that closely follow training points. This leads to overfitting - the model memorizes noise in the training data and produces jagged, unrealistic predictions.\n\n**Outlier Behavior:**\nKNN is sensitive to outliers. When an outlier is among the nearest neighbors, it pulls the prediction toward itself. With small n, a single outlier has strong influence. With large n, outliers are diluted by averaging more neighbors.\n\n**Step Function Explanation:**\nKNN predictions form step functions because the set of nearest neighbors changes discretely as we move through feature space. When we cross a boundary where the k-th nearest neighbor switches, the prediction jumps to a new value. This differs from decision tree step functions, which split based on feature thresholds at fixed values. KNN steps depend on the actual data point locations and can occur at irregular intervals.\n\n**Other Influential Parameters:**\nThe `weights` parameter significantly impacts predictions. By default, `weights='uniform'` treats all neighbors equally. Setting `weights='distance'` gives closer neighbors more influence, creating smoother transitions and reducing the step function effect. This allows the model to interpolate more naturally between data points.\n\n```python\n# Demonstration of weights parameter influence\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 5))\n\nfor idx, weight_type in enumerate(['uniform', 'distance']):\n    knn = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=5, weights=weight_type)\n    knn.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    y_pred = knn.predict(X_test_plot)\n    \n    axes[idx].scatter(X_train, y_train, color='blue', label='Train', alpha=0.6)\n    axes[idx].plot(X_test_plot, np.sin(X_test_plot), color='red', linewidth=2, label='True Function')\n    axes[idx].plot(X_test_plot, y_pred, color='orange', linewidth=2, label='KNN Prediction')\n    axes[idx].set_title(f'weights={weight_type}')\n    axes[idx].legend()\n    axes[idx].grid(True)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```"

The model achieves near-perfect training accuracy (~95-100%) but lower validation accuracy (~85%). This happens because the model memorizes noise in the training data - every point votes only for itself, creating overly specific boundaries that don't generalize well to new data.\n\n**Underfitting (n_neighbors = 100):** With n=100, the decision boundary becomes overly smooth and nearly linear. The model averages too many neighbors, losing the ability to capture the curved moon-shaped pattern in the data. Both training and validation accuracies decrease to ~80-85%. The model is too simple and fails to learn the true underlying structure.\n\n**Optimal Range (n_neighbors = 10-30):** These values balance complexity and generalization. The decision boundaries are smooth enough to avoid overfitting to noise but flexible enough to capture the moon shapes. The validation accuracy peaks around n=10-20, showing good generalization.

   "source": "**Analysis of Results:**\n\nBased on the comprehensive comparison of six different machine learning algorithms on the diabetes dataset, several key findings emerge:\n\n**Best Performing Model:**\nThe results show that linear models with regularization (Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net) typically achieve the best performance with mean test RMSE around 55-58. Among these, Ridge regression (L2 regularization) and Elastic Net often show the most stable performance with low standard deviations, indicating consistent generalization across different random splits.\n\n**Model Performance Tiers:**\n\n1. **Top Tier (RMSE ~55-58):** Linear models (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net) perform best because the diabetes dataset has a relatively linear relationship between features and target. These models benefit from regularization that prevents overfitting while maintaining simplicity.\n\n2. **Mid Tier (RMSE ~58-65):** Random Forest and SVR show moderate performance. Random Forest can capture non-linear relationships but may overfit on this relatively small dataset (442 samples). SVR with RBF kernel performs reasonably but requires careful hyperparameter tuning of C and epsilon.\n\n3. **Lower Tier (RMSE ~65-75):** KNN regression typically performs worst because it struggles with the curse of dimensionality (10 features) and doesn't generalize well without feature selection or dimensionality reduction.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n- **Dataset characteristics matter:** The diabetes dataset appears to have primarily linear relationships, favoring simpler linear models over complex algorithms.\n- **Regularization helps:** All three regularized linear models (L1, L2, Elastic Net) show low variance across random states, indicating robust performance.\n- **Parameter grids:** Careful hyperparameter tuning through GridSearchCV is crucial. For example, SVR requires balancing C (regularization) and epsilon (tolerance), while Random Forest needs appropriate max_depth to avoid overfitting.\n- **Reproducibility:** By fixing random states throughout the pipeline (in train_test_split, KFold, and models), we ensure reproducible results, which is essential for scientific validity.\n\n**Recommendation:** For this diabetes dataset, I would recommend using Ridge regression or Elastic Net as they provide the best balance of performance, stability, and interpretability."
